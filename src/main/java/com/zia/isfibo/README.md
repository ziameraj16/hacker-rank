# Problem
You are given an integer, N. Write a program to determine if N is an element of the Fibonacci sequence.

The first few elements of the Fibonacci sequence are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13... . A Fibonacci sequence is one where every element is a sum of the previous two elements in the sequence. The first two elements are 0 and 1.
### Input Format
The first line contains T, number of test cases. 
T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N.
### Output Format
Display IsFibo if N is a Fibonacci number and IsNotFibo if it is not. The output for each test case should be displayed in a new line.
### Sample Input
```

### Sample Output
```
IsFibo
IsNotFibo
